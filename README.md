# haskell99
This repo contains solutions for the Haskell problems based on the 99 LISP problems which originated from the 99 Prolog problems. The problems range from lists, to number theory, to trees, graphs, and other puzzles. Some of the solutions are mine, but many of the more clever solutions that are orders of magnitude better than mine are from Haskell99. Indeed, most of the later solutions are taken from Haskell99 and added here for me to play around with. A better discussion of the solutions can be found on Haskell99. All credit to the smart people posting their solutions there.

The problems can be found at [H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).
