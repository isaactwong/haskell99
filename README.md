# haskell99
This repo contains my solutions for the Haskell problems based on the 99 LISP problems which originated from the 99 Prolog problems. The problems range from lists, to number theory, to trees, graphs, and other puzzles.

The problems were taken from [H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems) along with some of the clever solutions I found there that were orders of magnitude better than mine.
